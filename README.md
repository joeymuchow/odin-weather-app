# odin-weather-app

This is a project from The Odin Project's Javascript course where we created a weather app to practice interacting with APIs.

I feel that I did a better job planning out what I was going to do for this project when compared with the todo list project. Also I think this was an easier project compared to the todo list since we are just fetching data and displaying it, there is not a lot of moving parts. Though my initial planning made things flow better so I never got stuck thinking I messed something up.

I still do not think I have any skill in design, the app doesn't look terrible, but it's not pretty either.
